\subsubsection{Personal Motivation.}

I have always been fascinated by embedded systems and the ability to do so much
with little hardware and strict limitations. This project seemed like a great
fit for a constrained problem to try optimizations I had in mind. The Doobit
storage system in particular was my goal for this project. It allowed us to
tiptoe the memory boundaries. A slight increase in consumption in any of the
tests easily leads to an overflow. Digital Signal Processing being another
interest of mine led to this being a favorite for project choice.
