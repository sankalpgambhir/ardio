My specific motivation towards this was to try and make a low level audio visualiser that typically accompany music these days to give it a nice aesthetic. However, most of these visualisers rely on Fourier Transforms which tend to be expensive. This is why I wanted to look into low level ways of getting similar data out.  I looked in the theory of correlations, did simulations for the viability of this data storage and sampling scheme, Setup the filtering and communication interface using the serial port apart from the common contributions to the main arduino program.
