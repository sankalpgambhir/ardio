My specific motivation towards this was to try and make a low level audio visualiser that typically accompany nice music these days to give it a nice aesthetic. I looked in the theory of correlations, did simulations for the viability of this data storage and sampling scheme, looked into communications using serial port as well other optimizations throughout.
