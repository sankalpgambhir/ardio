\begin{abstract}
Identification of sounds has immense applications in the embedded systems space,
ranging from simple detection of sounds to complete voice transcription. Being
able to do this on low power devices is an area of active interest. We present a
new approach to this problem involving bypassing a complete Fourier Transform
and approximating its results using a cross-correlation based approach pruning a
tree of (preset) frequencies. Our method returns present frequencies with
reasonable accuracy whilst maintaining the speed expected of such an embedded
system.
